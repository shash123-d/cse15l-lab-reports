Student debugging question:

**What environment are you using (computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)?**

I am using VSCode on mac

**Detail the symptom you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead. Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying “it doesn't work”.**

**Detail the failure-inducing input and context. That might mean any or all of the command you're running, a test case, command-line arguments, working directory, even the last few commands you ran. Do your best to provide as much context as you can.**

I put in the command javac StringServer.java to compile the file while i am in /Users/cibylin directory.
