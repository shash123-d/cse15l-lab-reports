> **Remotely Connecting**

After opening VSCode, open a new terminal from either the menu bar on the top of the screen(Terminal -> New Terminal)
or using control+shift+backwards quotation mark

In order to remotely connect to your account, we use ssh standing for secure shell.

Type in "ssh --account-name--"
In our case, it would look something like "ssh csxxxxx@ieng6.ucsd.edu"
